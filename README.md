# locationtest
Example how to use `nativescript-geolocation` and `nativescript-googleMaps` plugins.

> Note: This app uses google API keys generated for `org.nativescript.locationtest`. In order to use `nativescript-googlemaps` plugins in another application different API keys should be used.

> Google API key for Android is placed within `AndroidManifest.xml` file within `app/App_Resources/Android` folder. This manifest file will be merged with the final `AndroidManifest.xml`.

> Google API key for iOS is placed directly with `app/app.js` file as part of the Application onLaunch event handler.
